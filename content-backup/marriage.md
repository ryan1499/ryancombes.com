# Marriage + faith

*Rewriting my story on life-long union*



Marriage + faith Rewriting my story on life-long union Ryan Combes December 31, 2023 Hey friend, Been a minute, although things have not been uneventful. I’m currently in Switzerland with my girlfriend, her family, and a Syrian refugee (long story). Well, I guess “girlfriend” is now the outdated term, as we just got engaged. 😲 I proposed to her on a glacier in the Swiss alps which we arrived upon via helicopter. It was kinda wild. Here’s a pic: Now, I’m facing all of the emotions that come with the impending reality of marriage: Excitement, fear, joy, sorrow. It is easy for me to doubt the feasibility of marriage as a model. I’ve personally seen plenty of examples of it failing, my parents’ being one of them, and my own dad repeatedly “warned” me to never get into one. And yet, I just proposed to my girlfriend of one and a half years at the age of 24, much younger than I ever expected to, if at all. Why? I came across a line that I’d saved in my journal that speaks deeply to me in this moment: “I replace doubt with acts of faith.” I think “faith” is perhaps the only word to encapsulate the “reason” behind it. Not religious faith, although that is a part of my situation, but rather faith in myself, my partner, and our ability to rewrite the story of marriage in my life, together. When I feel past the fear into a deeper part of my heart, I know that we are capable of building a loving, trusting, beautiful life together. I know that the fear is there to protect me, but that I ultimately cannot let it dictate my life. I will not live in fear. The pressure to do so has been present all of my life. My dad, in what I still believe was a genuine effort to protect me, attempted to lead me into a life of fear, isolation, and self-preservation at all costs. The last ~10 years of my life have been a constant battle against his “warnings” and my own desire to live a richer, more expansive life. This chapter in the story feels like another lesson in doing this, in learning to discern true wisdom on the dangers of life from self-fulfilling fear. If I believe that my marriage is doomed to fail, then it will. If I feed those doubts and use all of the examples of failed marriages to convince myself that it is impossible, then it will be. However, I believe that if I replace those doubts with acts of faith , if I instead seek out all of the examples of happy, intimate, thriving marriages, and convince myself of its possibility , then it will be. It feels like one of the ultimate judges of confidence, of faith, both in myself, my partner, and, perhaps, in a power beyond comprehension. Here’s to a courageous, faithful, and loving 2024! All my best, Ryan
