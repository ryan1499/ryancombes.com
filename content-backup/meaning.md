# How to Live Meaningfully

*What digital nomadism taught me about a life well lived*



How to Live Meaningfully What digital nomadism taught me about a life well lived Ryan Combes July 04, 2023 Hey Friend, Today, I’m sharing an insight on building a meaningful life after traveling abroad for 6 months. Hopefully, it’ll help you choose what to prioritize in order to live the best life possible. Let s get into it. Story For a long time, I ve imagined my future as an international digital entrepreneur. I would live in one place for 2-6 months at a time and run my business from my laptop. It sounds sexy, doesn t it? Travel the world, make a ton of money, and have total freedom. Well, I just got back from five weeks in Bali, and while exciting, I felt a complete lack of meaning . I d work on my laptop in a cafe, surrounded by dozens of other white people doing the same thing. I felt like a clone. And in the Balinese waitresses eyes, I m sure I was. Problem It sounds exciting: Living in Bali, working on my laptop business, and traveling freely in the meantime. And it was. But here s what I ve realized: Excitement does not equal happiness. It s necessary, especially when young. But it s not everything. What excitement lacks is meaning. You go skydiving and you certainly feel excited. But it s like a sugar rush. You feel it for the moment, but it fades, and you re left as empty as you started (if not emptier). I don t want that. I want the grass-fed, free-range steak that s as nutrient-dense as a bamboo forest and will nourish me for days. Solution So what s the metaphorical steak ? What will provide me with more than just a momentary feeling of excitement to be alive? What will give me long-term contentment and meaning in my life? My best bet? Responsibility . Responsibility means being needed. And the best kind of responsibility is unique responsibility. Being needed because you are the only person who can do it. In Man s Search for Meaning (yep, still referencing that), it was the people who had a reason to live that made it out of Auschwitz. Whether it was a wife, a future book, or anything else, there needed to be a sense of unique responsibility. So the question I m asking myself is: Where am I needed? What am I uniquely suited to do? To pull from The Alchemist by Paul Coelho, what is my personal legend? My answer might involve my hometown, Hawai`i. Yours might not. But I invite you to consider who and what needs you the most and not try to play someone else s game. Don t try to impress an invisible jury judging you on your ability to win at something completely irrelevant to your individuality. That s what I realized I was doing with the international digital nomad pursuit. I was trying to be like the people I saw online. But that s someone else s game. I ll never win at that. Instead, I m making my own game, defining my own definition of success, and being the best at that. It s less stressful, more authentic, and generally more fulfilling. Conclusion That’s it. This one was a little late with all the traveling and time differences. I’ll find a new deadline to hold myself accountable to, but it’s a bit of a pain when traversing so many time zones. As always, if anything in this email piqued your interest, shoot me a reply. I’d love to chat about it with you and see if we can’t both grow a little wiser. Until next week, Much love, Ryan P.S. Favorite Discoveries What I m reading: The Histories by Herodotus as part of my Online Great Books program. According to the description, “Cicero called Herodotus ‘the father of history,’ and his only work, The Histories , is considered the first true piece of historical writing in Western Literature.” In other words, it’s the O.G. history book. I find it amusing that the justification for the first wars recorded in Western History is, “He took my woman.” A favorite quote: “Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times.” - Man’s Search for Meaning
