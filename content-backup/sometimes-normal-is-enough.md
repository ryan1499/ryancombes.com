# Sometimes, Normal Is Enough

*The simple sentence that cracks our script. *



Sometimes, Normal Is Enough The simple sentence that cracks our script. Ryan Combes September 20, 2025 Brave Enough Letters on fear, courage, and meaning — by Ryan Combes I said I was an atheist before my baptism. I lied. I was religious. I just didn t know it yet. It began at college in a tucked away corner of campus, where rays of sunlight poured gloriously through the skylight. While my peers slept or joked in the dining hall, I devoured my scripture: High Performance Habits. Pen scribbling madly, I noted everything it would take to reach salvation: self-actualization. I was an inductee into the religion of self-improvement, well on my way to high priesthood. Wealth, influence, total freedom — these were my end goals. And I was hell-bound to reach them. A quiet obsession had possessed me: the determination to live an extraordinary life. But what began as an invigorating belief in the potential of my life morphed into something darker and even more powerful: The fear of a mediocre one. Maybe you’ve felt it too — that quiet panic that being average equals failure. For me, it was more than chasing goals; it was the terror of doing nothing at all. That fear produced an anxious ambition — one scripted by others. If this religion had confession, mine would be simple: I don’t know why I’m doing this . It’s a confession many of us carry, even if we never say it out loud. I hit many targets, then moved them so joy never arrived. The question always returned: What’s next? I named this restlessness in a recent letter titled Achievement Isn’t Enough , where I admitted that success never gave me what I thought it would. It left me with questions I couldn’t quiet. In time, I realized the voice wasn’t mine. It was my fathers: mediocrity wasn’t mere failure — it was death. Then my mother-in-law said something that cracked the whole script. She made a passing comment that felt like heresy one moment, and blissful freedom in the next. Sometimes it s enough to just be normal. I was stunned. Every fiber of my being, hardened by hours of grinding, flared with defense. But I kept silent. Because underneath all the fury, I knew it was true. The question was whether I had the courage to admit it. Fear doesn t always look like running from the apocalypse. Sometimes it looks like pushing endlessly at school or work, convinced it s never enough. The hollowness of success, the exhaustion of sprinting toward a finish line that never comes. The self-improvement gods say: be more perfect. Faith has been teaching me something else: you are loved, despite your imperfection. One creates fear — we run from insufficiency. The other creates peace — we run toward joy. And it s only from that peace that the deeper things can grow — the ones that look like distractions but turn out to matter most. Creativity. Literature. Not tasks on a checklist, but rebellions against it. Practices that refuse anxious soil, but flourish in slower ground. Fear makes ambition a cage. Peace makes ambition a compass. When it points us toward what matters, ambition becomes joy. What would ambition look like if you already knew you were enough? With love, Ryan — P.S. Did this letter land for you? I’d love to hear about it. Please hit reply and let me know.
