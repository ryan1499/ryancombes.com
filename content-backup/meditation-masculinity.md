# Why Meditation is Crucial for Being a Good Man

*It's not just about reaching Enlightenment*



Why Meditation is Crucial for Being a Good Man It s not just about reaching Enlightenment Ryan Combes March 13, 2023 Hey friend, I am convinced that meditation is a necessary practice for being a good man. Here s why. A good man should be the sanctuary. An anchor in the storm. The one who holds and protects in times of danger and eventually leads the way out. How can a man be any of these things if he is volatile, emotional, and fearful himself? He cannot. If you agree with me, the question then becomes: How do I achieve this presence? While there is no magic bullet, I believe the best practice is meditation. Why? Meditation is many things, but at its core, it is the practice of being awareness . This might sound intangible. Let me try to explain. I had a conflict with my partner recently. It was probably the most intense conflict we ve ever had (I don t use the word fight intentionally, but that s another letter). In these moments, there were countless stories running through my head that tempted me into self-righteous anger, and I was certainly lost in them for a time. However, the thing that eventually saved me from this egotistical desire was my ability to disconnect from these stories themselves. To simply be aware of the stories without being the subject of them. My sense of victimhood dissipated and I was able to hold space for not only my stories, but her stories, too. To have compassion for both of us in this difficult moment and do my best to create a space she felt loved and held despite our conflict. Soon after, we were able to reconnect and our relationship is even stronger because of it. I certainly will not claim absolute responsibility for the happy ending (I am no saint, and my contribution was only half of the solution). Yet, when I reflect on this experience, I highly doubt I could have contributed and provided the presence I did without having spent 300+ hours in meditation. Relationships require leadership, especially in difficult moments. Someone needs to be the first to step out of the blame game, and that person needs a greater awareness to do so. I want to be the person others can look to for leadership and safety, and if you feel the same, I invite you to commit to a meditation practice, even if it is only 2 minutes a day at first. If you are interested, I highly recommend the introductory course of the Waking Up app (not sponsored, I wish...). I am personally doubling down on my dedication to the practice after this experience, and I have a deep intuition that it is one of the most valuable things I can do with my time. Here s to sitting! Until next time, Ryan P.S. New (short) videos this week: Build confidence in solitud e , how to instantly boost your mood , mushrooms and masculinity , and w hat will you sculpt ?
