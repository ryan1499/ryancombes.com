# Making Myself Broke (On Purpose)

*A (not so) crazy idea? *



Making Myself Broke (On Purpose) A (not so) crazy idea? Ryan Combes February 16, 2023 Hey friend, I m considering intentionally making myself broke. Here s the thing: I made a good chunk of money during COVID due to starting a business and lucky investing (thanks crypto). I proceeded to lose a good chunk of it (thanks crypto), but still hold onto the identity of being not broke . I think that identity is hurting me more than helping, as I am simultaneously comfortable and anxious about money . I have enough to get by and travel, but am worried about running out because that would dissolve my identity of being not broke . So, while not broke, I am in a subtle but persistent state of fear of losing what I have. This begs the question: What if I DID lose what I have? I tell myself that I d be able to make back whatever I lose, be it $10k or $10m. But do I actually believe it? I realized today while in a sauna (which are apparently referred to as truth barrels ) that this idea, while completely counter to wise financial practice , could actually be one of the most valuable things I could do . I fear that the scarcity-minded environment I grew up in, particularly around money, will prevent me from truly enjoying the fruits of wealth even after I achieve it. Wealth is, after all, an arbitrary concept, and if I struggle to spend with $10k or $100k, why would I expect that to change at $1m or $10m? By intentionally stripping it from myself, when I have no responsibilities and could sleep on couches if it came down to it, I could prove to myself that losing money is not a death sentence and free myself from a fear that I feel lies deep within me. Then, I could rebuild my financial well-being from an abundant, less fearful place, and would not fear losing what I make in the same way in the future. This freedom sounds really, really nice, and I ve already noticed myself feeling lighter today just with the possibility of not worrying about running out of money (but that s a whole other letter). I m curious to hear what you all think of this idea. I count a lot of you as some of my closest friends with wisdom to share. Am I crazy? Is there a better way to achieve the same outcome? Or am I onto something here? Let me know!! Until next time. Much love Ryan P.S. Made a few pieces of content recently like finding spirituality in the mundane , what to do when you travel to really understand a place , and finding out what you re hiding from yourself .
