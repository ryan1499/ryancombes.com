# I Want to Be a Warrior

*Rediscovering my primal self...*



I Want to Be a Warrior Rediscovering my primal self... Ryan Combes November 02, 2022 Howzit friend! When I was a kid, I played more than my fair share of video games. I particularly loved games like Skyrim, RuneScape, and this one sick ninja game on MiniClip that I forget the name of. â€‹ This makes me realize: I want to be a warrior. â€‹That might sound intense, like I want to go join the army and mess people up, but I don t think it is. I think, instead, that there is a need deep in my masculine core to be strong, capable, and anchored. â€‹ That might mean to be able to survive in the woods for days at a time, to be trained in combat sports to be able to defend myself and others if the time comes, or to simply know who I am and what I am capable of at a deep level. â€‹And I don t think the path determined for me by society is conducive to these values. Outside of the gym, there is hardly anything about my life that addresses these needs. â€‹Which means I need to address them myself. Step one: Spend a night in the woods by myself ! â€‹ This is the journey I m on, but I m curious if any of you share a similar desire to connect more with your masculine energy (even if you re a girl!)? I can t imagine I m the only one that feels disconnected from this part of myself. Also, if you haven t noticed, I ve been bombarding my Youtube , Instagram and (new!) TikTok with short videos on things ranging from how to run more, why I meditate, and my insight into fear s role in my own self-improvement. Check em out if any of those catch your eye! Until next week. â€‹ Much love, Ryan P.S. Reading this online? Sign up below to be emailed posts like this weekly.ðŸ‘‡
