# Life is Hard

*And that's okay. *



Life is Hard And that s okay. Ryan Combes February 03, 2023 Hey friend, Life is hard. I never liked that phrase. To me, it felt like a self-defeating attitude. Better to believe that it is easy and manifest it. But life is hard. I have cried more in the past 3 months than 3 years. I have had more moments of crisis, self-doubt, and intense fear than ever before. And yet, I feel like I am on the right path more than ever . This would have seemed a paradox to me before. Success means more positive emotions, right? I don t think so. Success is about depth. Intensity. Vitality. The most harrowing journeys are the ones that shape us the most. I now see difficulty as opportunity. An indicator towards what needs attention, exploration, and nurturing. It will probably be hard. I will probably cry (now that that hole seems to have been unplugged). And I will probably feel more whole than ever on the other side. Integration. There is a reason Carl Jung claimed integrating our shadow is our most difficult yet important task. I am on my journey. Wish me luck, and I hope to see you out there, too. Much love, Ryan P.S. Only one clip out recently on a difference I observed between Japan and the US (I have been in Japan for a week now).
