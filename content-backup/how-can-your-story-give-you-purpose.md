# How Can Your Story Give You Purpose? 

*A guide to finding your unique offering to the world*



How Can Your Story Give You Purpose? A guide to finding your unique offering to the world Ryan Combes November 09, 2022 Two weeks ago, I was in one of the bathrooms at Babson when I saw a poster on the wall for the Babson Speech Center. I d never gone, and figured with all the Youtube things I was doing, it d help to get professional feedback. I scheduled an appointment. Yesterday was my appointment, and holy shit, it was incredible. And my consultant didn t even look at my videos or have me speak . Instead, I told her my story. My life story. As some of you may know, my life story is pretty wack. I grew up in Hawai`i because my dad wanted to escape the impending food, economic, and civil collapse he believed (and still believes) was coming. To escape it, we moved as far away from civilization as my mom would agree to (he preferred to go to Australia). After they divorced and as I got older (15), he started pounding on me to jump ship myself and move to Australia with him to live on a farm, stating that I was risking my life by not doing so. Needless to say I had to figure some things out at a young age most kids don t have to, and my experiences since then have also been...unique... This all to say that I have unique skills, interests, and opportunities given my background, and that is true for everyone, including you. What kind of crazy shit did your parents get up to? How did that influence you as a child (because it definitely did)? What weird curiosities did you have when you were young? The answers to these questions will give you insight into what your unique offering to the world is, and the best way I ve found so far to answer them is to tell your story . Ideally tell it to someone who has some experience in storytelling/speaking, but even if it is just to a friend or family member, do it! Have them take notes on what stands out most to them, what seems most unique or interesting to your experience. This will give you the firepower to understand how to craft a unique offering to the world in whatever you do, giving you both a competitive edge (nobody can beat you at being you) and purpose . Why purpose? Because the opposite of purpose is waking up in the morning and feeling like anybody could do what you re about to do - a cog in a machine. Purpose is waking up and knowing that you are needed . As Naval Ravikant says, Your goal in life is to find out the people who need you the most . And what you re most suited to do going forward depends on where you ve been . So tell your story (I ll be doing much more of this from now on). I haven t read it yet (it s in my library), but there s a book called Choose Your Story, Change Your Life by Kindra Hall that seems to be related to this topic. There s also Mastery by Robert Greene, which I HAVE read and is amazing for this same thing. OK, I think that s all for now. I m pumped on this topic right now and may bust out a video on it soon, but in the meantime check out all the content I ve been posting on TikTok , IG and YT if you haven t. Topics include making covert contracts (what are those??), the easiest way to lose weight, how to start your day for maximum momentum, attracting women and more. If you can t tell, I m throwing a bunch of shit at the wall right now to see what sticks. Take a look and I ll catch you next week. Much love, Ryan
