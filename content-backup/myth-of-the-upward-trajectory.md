# The Myth of the Upward Trajectory

*What Idle Time Reveals About the Life You’re Really Living*



The Myth of the Upward Trajectory What Idle Time Reveals About the Life You’re Really Living Ryan Combes August 03, 2025 Dear friend, A few weeks ago, I sat in the living room of my Airbnb in France, watching the cursor blink on an empty page. For months, I told myself work was the reason I wasn t writing. Now I was unemployed. No meetings. No deadlines. Just time—everything I thought I needed. And yet, writing felt just as hard. Which forced me to confront an uncomfortable question: Do I really want to write—or just like imagining myself as someone who does? Most of us have something like this— a calling, or at least the idea of one. Something that feels tied to a meaningful life. But if we keep finding reasons to avoid it, what does that say? Unstructured time—whether a few idle hours or months of unemployment— has a way of telling the truth. In the grind, it s easy to say, I ll do that when I have more—time, energy, money. Lately, I ve wondered if that belief—that I ll be more capable later—is just a story I like telling myself. I ve started calling it the myth of the upward trajectory. What if I m not on a steady climb at all? What if I drift downward—toward ease, toward comfort—unless I fight for something higher? Every day, I m casting a vote for who I ll become. And when I put something off, it doesn t feel neutral—it feels like I m teaching myself it s not important. The opposite is true too: one small act today makes the next one easier. Like a rocket burning most of its fuel to get off the ground, the hardest part is starting. But if I can break through, momentum will help carry me forward. Maybe what matters most is not what we say we want, but what our days keep revealing. Maybe saying I want to be a writer matters far less than writing—even for five minutes. What would you change if you believed this: that what you do today is what you ll keep doing for the rest of your life? A meaningful life rarely appears overnight. More often, it’s the result of quiet courage repeated every day—sitting down to do the thing, even when gravity fights you all the way. I close the laptop now. Not because I ve solved anything, but because I want to write again tomorrow. I hope you’re well. With love, Ryan
