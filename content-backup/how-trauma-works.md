# How Trauma Works (And Why You Should Care)

*What triggers you says a lot about where you should look*



How Trauma Works (And Why You Should Care) What triggers you says a lot about where you should look Ryan Combes December 06, 2022 When are you left speechless? And I don t mean in the I m amazed way. I had an experience over the summer where I was left speechless in a I feel so emotionally stressed and exhausted I can t even think, let alone speak . The person I was with said I had a blank look in my eyes, like I shut down. This memory has stuck with me. It felt like a tidal wave of emotion hit me, yet I was staying completely still, allowing myself to be enveloped in it. Turns out, this is not an uncommon experience and is the result of trauma (yep, we got a fun newsletter this time!). Lil Bit on Trauma According to Bessel Van Der Kolk in his book The Body Keeps the Score , when we are exposed to something that reminds us of a traumatic experience, the part of our brain associated with speech (Broca s area) literally shuts off. Meanwhile, another part of the brain associated with images, smells, sounds, etc. (Brodmann s area 19) lights up. This puts the person quite literally back into the moment, without being able to speak or convey their emotions in words. Can you recall a moment where you were so emotionally overwhelmed you could not speak? If so, this might indicate a (perhaps minor) form of PTSD. Something happened that reminded you, consciously or unconsciously, of a traumatic experience. I don t know what triggered me. Might ve been a feeling of abandonment or something else entirely. But what I do know is that I have certainly experienced trauma in little and big ways throughout my life. I also know that these are affecting me today whether I know it or not. Therefore, I d rather be aware of what s going on and work through it so I can avoid causing unnecessary suffering for myself and others. This is, in essence, what talk therapy and other tools do. If you have similar interests/ambitions, I d recommend checking out the book I mentioned ( The Body Keeps the Score ) and make some form of therapy a priority in your life. You can hear my Lessons from My First Year of Therapy on Youtube if you d like. :) ALSO, I ve put up quite a bit of content recently, like a new YT video on How to Inspire (Without Being an Asshole) and short videos on Dealing with Overwhelm , Following Through on Your Goals , and Curing Insecurity . Check em out as always! Much love and see ya next week (or sometime around then), Ryan
