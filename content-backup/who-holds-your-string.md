# Who Holds Your String? 

*A different way to fight the battles in your mind*



Who Holds Your String? A different way to fight the battles in your mind Ryan Combes August 09, 2025 Brave Enough Letters on fear, courage, and meaning I grew up with my head in the clouds — not in daydreams, but in fears. It wasn’t courage that brought me down, but something softer. Dear friend, Six weeks after I was born, my family moved to escape the apocalypse. My father s fear drove us from our dream home to the mountains. Nothing happened. But the fear stayed — and in different ways, it shaped both of us. For the next 20 years, I lived with constant anxiety about The End Times. From nuclear attacks to mass starvation, there was always another threat to prepare for. Imagine someone drifting past clouds, terrified of what s inside each one. He swings a sword through the mist, but it passes right through. There s no way to win. This is what anxiety feels like. I see myself in this image — only the fears have changed: not vaccines or chemtrails, but going broke or not being enough. It s become clear why I pursued self-improvement and entrepreneurship after my childhood: I wanted control. I thought if I built enough armor, I could keep the clouds from getting to me. And it worked — sometimes. But the armor was heavy. I was tired of carrying it alone. My wife asked me recently how I think our relationship has influenced me. Love changes the image. Instead of drifting alone, there s another figure far below, standing on solid ground. They re gently tugging a string tied to the man, pulling him down from the clouds. When he lands, they wrap him in a hug. The man softens and sighs in great relief. Love doesn’t just pull him to the ground — it gives him the courage to fight the battles that actually matter. Now, he can face the real threats — and not by himself. Those around him help fasten the armor, then cheer as he charges into life s battles, grounded in love. The fight doesn t disappear. But now it s shared. And when love shares the fight, it makes you braver for it. It isn t always easy to come down. We might resist the tug, claiming those on the ground don t understand our battle. We believe the fight truly is up there. But it s not. I still drift toward the clouds. Maybe I always will. But I m learning to feel the string in my hands — and let it draw me home. Who, or what, is holding yours? I hope you’re well. With love, Ryan — P.S. If this made you think of someone, I’d be honored if you shared it with them.
