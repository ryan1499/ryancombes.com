# Don't Read This Newsletter



Don t Read This Newsletter Ryan Combes June 04, 2023 Hey Friend, Today, I feel like trash. I 100% have food poisoning and it feels like at least 7 other things. My health watch tells me I’m at a 6% recovery compared to my typical 80-90%. The world looks dim. Like everybody else is having a trash day, too. Strange. I want to write something. I really do. I just started trying to extract some insight on money and tourism from this long-ass tour I did around Bali yesterday. But it simply exhausted me. If this were truly just a letter to a friend, I think I would say: Sorry, not sorry. The idea of spending an hour or more trying to write a compelling newsletter this Sunday compared to going back to rewatching Better Call Saul (recommend - Breaking Bad spinoff) for the first time in six years just doesn’t do it for me right now. So, I’m going to give myself permission to skip a week and rest, which could be a whole newsletter topic in and of itself (how hard to push?). But not today. I’ll leave you with a couple recommendations instead. I hope they do something for ya. Until next week, Much love, Ryan P.S. Favorite Discoveries A favorite quote: “All your actions, feelings, behaviors—even your abilities—are always consistent with this self-image.” - Maxwell Maltz, Psycho-Cybernetics What I m re-reading: Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. I’ve been thinking and reading about self-identity this week, specifically when it comes to money and wealth. Building from last week’s newsletter, I think we underestimate the power of our self-image in creating the lives we want. This book was written by a surgeon who noticed dramatic differences in patient outcomes irrespective of the objective results. In other words, some people would be ecstatic and 100x more confident after surgery, and the others wouldn’t even believe anything was different. He observed how powerful the self-image is and what we can do to change it to optimize for success/happiness/etc. Check it out.
