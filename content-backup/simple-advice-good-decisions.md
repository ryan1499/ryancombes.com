# Simple advice I didn’t appreciate until now



Simple advice I didn’t appreciate until now Ryan Combes June 02, 2024 Hey friend, It s my two-year anniversary with my fiancee today. I m writing this newsletter in a cabin in Wisconsin, looking out over a lake. It s peaceful and lovely. The birds are singing, the sunlight is peeking through the clouds, and there are boats going by with fishermen casting their lines, hoping for a catch. Perfect writing conditions, right? Wrong. I ve been struggling to put some clear thoughts down on paper for the past 3 hours, so I ll start with a story that will hopefully lead me somewhere worthwhile. Back in Hawai`i I had a barber named Colin. He was a pretty normal dude, perhaps 10 years older than me, and conversation with him was mostly bro-to-bro. He made me feel like an equal, as any good conversationist does. We would chat about normal, somewhat small-talky things, until the end. After I paid, as I walked out the door, he would offer a small, seemingly innocuous piece of advice: make good decisions. I would nod and say something like, of course, not thinking much of it. Of course I ll make good decisions, I thought, who wouldn t? It isn t dawning on me until now, about 7 years later, how crucial the subject matter of this advice is. I recall a quote from an author whose name I can t remember: the quality of your decisions determine the quality of your life. I don t think the importance of this can be overstated (which is probably why Colin would repeat it every single time). There are a few things in particular that stand out to me about this phrase: 1) It s self-responsible. My decisions determine my life, not anyone else s. 2) It s expansive. I can decide to have a high quality of life, do great things and build something I m proud of. This is empowering and exciting for me, given how much I love being in control of my own destiny (or at least feeling like it). 3) It s open-ended. It implies that I can get better at making decisions. I am not just born with good or bad decision-making, but it s something that I can work on and improve. When I reflect on my life to-date, the truth of this statement becomes crystal clear. Every good thing I have in my life, whether it be my education, my job, or my relationship, is the result of an active (and intimidating) decision. I decided go to school, even though it meant leaving the place and people that I loved and was comfortable with. I decided to start a business by cold calling and pitching my digital marketing services and then, more recently, to jump on an employment opportunity that came my way. And last but not least, I decided to approach a girl on the beach and then, more recently, to propose and secure a loving life together. I don t mean to claim I m the decision-making god. I know there are plenty of poor decisions that I ve made, probably even more than there are good ones (one I ve been reminded of every day for the last 9 months is trying to deadlift without enough stretching beforehand). But what becomes clear is that every decision is not equal in weight. I can make the wrong decision 90% of the time but, as long as those remaining 10% are the important ones (such as who I surround myself with), I ll be okay. I ll end this letter with a prompt for reflection: What decisions have you made that led you to where you are, and what decisions will you make in the next year that deserve time for thought? I wish you the best in making them, and since I can t resist, I ll give one a small piece of advice myself: make them with courage. Until next week. Take care, Ryan
