# How to Find Bliss

*Lessons from one of the most blissful moments of my life*



How to Find Bliss Lessons from one of the most blissful moments of my life Ryan Combes February 26, 2023 Hey friend, 4 days ago, I had one of the most blissful, serene moments of my life . I wandered, aimlessly, in the mountains of Japan and found myself in the middle of a forest. Snow falling, a quiet creek running, and the occasional bird chirp. Complete. Serenity. I almost started crying at the beauty of the world, and I walked away from that day filled with more gratitude, presence, and lightness than I had felt in a long time. Then I went to Universal Studios Japan (USJ) - basically Japanese Disneyland. I already made a video complaining about the consumerism there, so I won t do that again. Instead, I just want to point out the fundamental difference I see between the two experiences. Mountains: Stillness. USJ: Movement. This is not just physical - it is experiential. Every moment of USJ is filled with anticipation and adrenaline. It s why you go. To go on rides, to try the weird foods, to buy your favorite movie-themed stuffed animal. When you aren t experiencing a hit of some kind, you re looking forward to the next one (that is why you re willing to stand in 2-hour lines). In the mountains, staring at the falling snow, becoming utterly lost in the beauty of the moment, there is no anticipation. There is only that moment. That awe-inspiring, serene, blissful moment. It doesn t last, of course, but the entire attitude towards the experience is utterly different from that of USJ. I won t claim that USJ and everything I argue it represents is worthless or corrupt. Excitement, fun, pleasure: All these things are valuable, especially with friends. What I will say is that I think we should approach these things knowing what they are: A drug . Just like alcohol (or another drug of your choice), pleasure and anticipation of pleasure can be a tool in living a fuller life. But become dependent on it, and you re in trouble. We should (ideally) be able to return from these experiences not craving the next one. Not NEEDING the next hit, but rather enjoying it if it comes along. This constant state of need is what I was critiquing in the video on consumerism, and addressing this suffering from attachment/craving is what lies at the core of Buddhism. For me, learning to do this means meditation and spending time in nature . I ve learned that if I struggle to be happy or content in those environments, then I will certainly fail to achieve any lasting contentment in day-to-day life. On the flip side, if I find contentment there, then everything else becomes that much more enjoyable. So here s an invitation to you: Get lost in nature . Spend time there without any input be it phone, book, etc. Make a habit out of it if you can, and I promise you ll be glad you did. I certainly am. Til next week! Much love, Ryan P.S. Some new content out on what being an “old soul” actually might mean , what confidence is , the Japanese saying “shikata nai ne” and its application to self-improvement , and money and being a good man (dang I’ve been good this week!).
