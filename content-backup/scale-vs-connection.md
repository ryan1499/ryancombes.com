# Scale vs. Connection

*What are we really after?? *



Scale vs. Connection What are we really after?? Ryan Combes January 15, 2023 What s up friend, I m a little brain dead but it has been way too damn long since I wrote one of these so here I am. There has been a lot going on. Just finished my last semester of school in Boston for good, currently in Hawai`i and preparing for my next and final semester of school in Kyoto, Japan. I know close to zero Japanese. Let s go. When I m back in Hawai`i, I feel connected. Not just to myself and the environment I m in, but to others. I see my clients for my digital marketing work and go visit lil ol ladies to help them with their technology (for some reason it s always ladies??). Regardless, it feels really great to be appreciated, in person, for the work that I do, and it has gotten me thinking about entrepreneurship and what kind of business I want. I had an (unsuccessful) ecommerce business going for a while, and the only people I d interact with were customer support reps. Even if that business had been successful, I don t know how fulfilling it d actually be. When I started, instead, cold-calling businesses here in Hawai`i to sell digital marketing services and working with people in person, it was so much more fulfilling. I get to see the real impact of my expertise and effort. I get to look in the other person s eyes and see them light up when they realize what I helped them with. That s got to be worth some $$$$. Are we after scale, or connection? Sure, I could scale an ecommerce biz to millions per year, travel the world lavishly and ball out. But would I be happy? Or would I be happier making 10% but interacting with people who care about and appreciate me on a daily basis? I think I know my answer. I don t know what this feeling looks like for me in the future, but I do know that I m placing a lot more value on personal connection in business than just money these days. That s something that growing up in Hawai`i taught me: Community/family (ohana) is the most important thing. Success can be isolating. Doesn t mean we shouldn t be successful, but the billionaire lifestyle might not be what we re after (I just watched this video on How the World s Wealthiest People Travel and tbh it seems exhausting). Maybe having a business that gives me enough freedom while still connecting me with others is the real success. Whatcha think? Lemme know. Maybe it won t be another month before I write one of these. Maybe it will. No promises. So much for Mr. Discipline. Much love, Ryan P.S. I ve posted some stuff semi-recently on Finding Purpose as a Man , 3 Actions to Take Upon Waking , and.....not really anything else. :( Someone s gotta get their shit together!
